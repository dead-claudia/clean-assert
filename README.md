# clean-assert

A simple TDD assertion library, initially designed for [Thallium](https://www.npmjs.com/package/thallium), but factored out as a separate module for use elsewhere. It's also modular, with its core factored out into [`clean-assert-util`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clean-assert-util) so you can write your own assertions that look just like this one, without any hassle and without declaring a direct dependency on this (that package is much more stable).

**Note:** If you're concerned about the very minimal Git/version history, this library *is* actively maintained, and I personally use this with production projects; it's just very stable and what you might consider mostly done. Probably one of those 0.00001% of projects that are generally bug-free.

## Installation

Install via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clean-assert):

```
npm install --save clean-assert
```

## API

See [here](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/clean-assert/blob/master/api.md).

## Examples

See the [tests](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/clean-assert/tree/master/test). This assertion framework uses itself to test.

[ESLint](https://eslint.org) with [my preset](https://github.com/isiahmeadows/eslint-config-isiahmeadows) is used to lint, and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) is used to run the tests. Most of the source code is in `lib/`, and the tests are all in `test/`.

The implementation is generally composed of a combination of DSLs to avoid a large amount of repetition, since most of the assertions fit the mold of "type check, test something, then throw an error if it failed".
